- Blander's File Impoter is excellent, but sometimes it is a little annoying when you want to simply import several files lightly. I’ve been searching for 3D resources, especially when they didn’t work as a drag-and-drop feature in the viewport, because I wanted to know why they didn’t. Thanks to this, I was able to learn about the implementation perspective of Blander. And now I can understand it.
- But still, due to the absence of drag and drop function, I felt uncomfortable, and sometimes I searched and found that many people in the world 've been still complaining and bothering. So while making a hard rock music video with Great 3D Solution called Blender, I create and share this second add-on. As usual, I'm not professional, so the code is always trashy and shitty. I hope you understand me because,  it's not so easy for Hard Rocker to code programs.
